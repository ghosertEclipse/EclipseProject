1. add Mobile.isConnected method for OpenMobilePortAction and CloseMobilePortAction
2. There will be no response from port when I send a new message to target Telephone.
   Long time waiting. click on "Send!" button on quick send view to repeat the problem.
3. depart MobileException with MobileException and PortException
4. change MobileFactory to singleton ( DONE )
5. I modify the Java Communication API comm.jar, because it doesn't support to renew 
   available COM port list. Scenario case is: Application start to monitor mobile port,
   but nothing is found, then user open IRDA( simulate COM ) on mobile and connect with 
   PC, if the application re-monitor the port, nothing is found yet, only the user can 
   do is to close and re-open application to renew COM port list. so I modify the  
   CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers() method in comm.jar to reload COM port list
   when invoking this method every time.
   This is not a good way, I don't know whether it will affect other part of the code.
   The best way is to open the port with IRDA way directly, not COM simulation.
6. NewSMSDialog class add split SMS function, this function can be used to distinguish

    mobile memory once again. the older phonebook item will be replaced by the new one. This is not a bug, but
    should inform the customer to avoid saving phonebook item with the existing phonebook name in mobile memory.

//                        showResendSMSDialogAction.setEnabled( false );
