Notes:
1. If you want to create a new c/c++ dll project, you should choose
   the project type as Makefile project, this will allow you define and execute
   your own makefile. Other project type make project automatic leading to
   something wrong.

2. For the makefile, you should add a TAB in the front of each command line.
   Or there will be a error when executing the make command.
